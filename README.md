# 🎨 Neural Style Transfer
The Neural Style Transfer project is a deep learning–based application that blends the content of one image with the artistic style of another image. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the model extracts high-level content features from a content image and style patterns from a style image, then combines them to generate a visually appealing stylized output.

This project uses a pre-trained deep learning model (such as VGG-19) to capture texture, color, and spatial information from images. The content image structure is preserved while the artistic elements—such as brush strokes, colors, and textures—from the style image are applied. The result is a creative fusion that transforms ordinary photographs into artwork inspired by famous painting styles.
